    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Professor James Spilker's career:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>From 1958 to 1963</strong> -  Spilker worked as a research supervisor at Lockheed Research Labs in Palo Alto, 
        California, where he invented an optimal tracking device for spread-spectrum signals and devised technology to 
        communicate with aircraft flying to/from Berlin when Russia blockaded Berlin</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1963</strong> - he became manager of the Communications Sciences Department of Ford Aerospace Corporation where 
        he led and managed efforts on both satellite communications ground terminals and military communications satellite 
        payloads for the first quasi-stationary communications satellites, and developed multiple access technologies for 
        various satellite communications and became Director of Communications Systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1973</strong> - he co-founded Stanford Telecommunications Inc. (referred to as Stanford Telecom) with Marshall 
        Fitzgerald and John Brownie. Stanford Telecom was the first of his three Silicon Valley startup companies, with three 
        people and no VC funding. As the company's Executive Chairman, he grew the military satellite communications and GPS 
        company to over 1,300 employees in 5 states when he sold it in 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2001</strong> - Spilker has been a consulting professor at Stanford University in the Electrical Engineering 
        and Aeronautics and Astronautics Department.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2005</strong> - Prof. Spilker co-founded the Stanford University Research Center for Position, Navigation and 
        Time, which continues today and has an annual International Symposium at Stanford University with invited speakers 
        from around the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2012</strong> - Spilker and his wife, Anna Marie Spilker, a real estate broker and investor, donated $28 million 
        to Stanford University to gift The James and Anna Marie Spilker Engineering and Applied Sciences Building and endow a 
        professorship in the School of Engineering. The building is one of four new structures in Stanford Science and 
        Engineering Quad.
